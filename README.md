# Galaxy3DShapeAnalyzer
The routine of obtaining the intrinsic 3D shape distributions of galaxies given the projected size-shape distributions. This code is used to analyze the 2D projected size-shape distributions of CANDELS star-forming galaxies in order to infer their intrinsic shape distributions. Anyone who is interested is more than welcome to use this code.
