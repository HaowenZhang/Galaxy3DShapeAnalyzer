0. Purpose
 	This is a object-oriented (poorly-written, though) code that decomposes the ***projected*** b/a axis ratio-lgSMA distribution in order to investigate the evolution of galaxies' intrinsic shapes with CANDELS data. Specifically, we used GALFIT measurements of ***projected*** b/a axis ratios and (log10 of) half-light semi-major axis of star-forming galaxies with 0.5 < z < 2.5 and 9.0 < log(M_*). < 10.5. For more details please see Zhang et al. (2019, arXiv: 1805.12331). Although we used it for this particular sample, this code can be used to model projected b/a-lgSMA distributions of any galaxy sample, as long as one can measure their redshift, stellar mass, projected b/a, and SMA.

1. About the Code:
	1.1 Dependencies
		1.1.1 Python2
			This code is written when I was still using Python2, therefore one has to have a Python2 executable to run this code.
		1.1.2 SciPy
			This package will be used to calculate some special functions,do some statistical manipulations (e.g. 2D histogram making), and to read data from .mat files
		1.1.3 NumPy
			This package will be used to do some trigonometric and linear algebra calculations.
		1.1.4 emcee
			The Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) in this code is done with emcee, a commonly used MCMC package developed by Dan Foreman-Mackey (at NYU) and other contributors.
		1.1.5 schwimmbad
			This package provides the API needed for using MPI in emcee.
		1.1.6 corner
			This package will be used to generate classical corner plots in the analysis of MCMC results.
		1.1.7 pandas
			This package will be used to read data that are stored in text files.
		1.1.8 h5py
			This package will be used to read some large chunk of data stored in .mat files.
		1.1.9 Other built-in packages


	1.2 Notes about the notations
		The meaning of symbol "a" in this code is sometimes confusing. So to clarify: All the "a" in the occurence of "(E, T, a)" refers to ***the log10 of*** the longest main axis of the galaxy, namely, the (E, T, a) here is equivalent to the "(E, T, \gamma)" in Zhang et al. (2019); while when it comes to ***projected*** b/a, "a" refers to the half-light semi-major axis measured by GALFIT (for real galaxies) or calculated from the ellipsoid projection algorithm (i.e. axis_ratio_2d()) (for model galaxies); "a" in the occurences of "intrinsic c/a" or "intrinsic b/a" refer to the intrinsic longest main axis, not its log10.

	1.3 Usage:
		The usage of the code is basically shown by the example in the "main function" at the bottom of the code. Basically one needs to generate an ensemble of ***projected b/a-lgSMA*** distributions (or two-dimensional histograms) corresponding to a series of (E, T, a) values and use them as basis to decompose the observed b/a-lgSMA distribution. Note that the file containing these bases is large. After generating these bases, one can go ahead using them to do modeling.

		To do modeling, one needs a .mat file containing the variable "mass", "redshift", "ba", "sma", corresonding to the arrays of stellar masses, redshifts, projected b/a axis ratios, and ***log10 of*** half-light semi-major axes of the observed galaxy population.

		Making plots based on the best fitting parameters is relatively easy, please see the examples in the code.

	1.4 Apology
		This is a poorly-written Python2 code that tries to be object-oriented, but I think this is a bad experiment. So I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience in using the code due to my coding skill.
		If you have any questions/problems about the code, please send emails to: hwzhang0595@email.arizona, or zhw11387@gmail.com, and I will try to help as much as I can.
